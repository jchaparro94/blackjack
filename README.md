# Blackjack
### A Blackjack game which allows the user to play against the computer.

## Overview
#### This app allows the user to play a Blackjack game against the computer. With some automation, the computer will continue to draw cards on it's own, attempting to win the game by getting to 21.

#### This was a practice app which was created from personal notes taken from a series of videos. Once I understood all the basic fundamentals of how the game should work, I decided to create it myself.

## Languages/Technologies Used

## Improvements
